## Overview

Traggo is a tag-based time tracking tool. In Traggo there are no tasks, only tagged time spans.

With tags, Traggo tries to be as customizable as possible, for example if you work on different projects you could add a project-tag. If you like to see statistics from the different things you do, you could add a type-tag with values like email, programming, meeting. You can do it just as you like.

### Features

- easy to setup
- time tracking (obviously)
- customizable dashboards with diagrams
- a list and calendar view of the tracked time
- sleek web ui with multiple themes
- simple user management

**Shipped version:** 0.2.3~ynh1
